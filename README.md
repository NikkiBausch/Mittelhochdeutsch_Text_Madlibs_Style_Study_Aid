<ul>A simple Python Madlibs-style application designed to assist with:
  <li>translation of Mittelhochdeutsch texts to German or English </li>
  <li> memorization of Mittelhochdeutsch vocabulary and grammar/syntax norms</li> 
  </li> Or you can just it to be silly and transform the poem into something else entirely. </li>
  </ul>
  <ul> Additional UI/UX issues to research: 
  <li> How to present the original Mittelhochdeutsch with the published translation as a guide, since the word order is often changed to accommodate rhyme and metric in the translation. </li>
  <li>Add a feature that displays the original as a guide, but not as part of the word problem (as that would be too cluttered)</li>
